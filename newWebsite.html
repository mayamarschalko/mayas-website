    <p id="my-lovely-first-paragraph">
      Me and my dad made a park short film with stop motion and lego. I made it
      with LEGO and built them together. Every time I moved just a little bit of
      something on the scene we took a photo. After I created lots of photos my
      dad put them together to make a short film.
