    <h1>STOP MOTION VIDEOS</h1>

    <p>Me and my dad made a park short film with stop motion and lego. I made it with LEGO and built them together.
        Every time I moved just a little bit of something on the scene we took a photo. After I created lots of photos
        my dad put them together to make a short film.</p>
